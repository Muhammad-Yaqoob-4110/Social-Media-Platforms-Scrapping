UgyDklf1KN3ilk3K9dJ4AaABAg,2023-10-03T15:01:35Z,@JeanSuman,"I tried to make a loop to get all the videos from a channel and scrape all the comments. However, it gave the following error &quot;the request cannot be completed because you have exceeded your quota&quot; - From what I understand, the API has a daily request limit, is that it? - In fact, when the video has a private comment, the request returns 403."
